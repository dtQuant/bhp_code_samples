# bhp_code_samples

These files are just sample code from a React Native project BrewHopPass that included 15 screens, multiple navigators, and other features to illustrate my skill with this 
technology. The code was written to use PHP endpoints as APIs to get, post, and manipulate data on backend.

These files were early commits in the app development process. They have been refactored to eliminate unnecessary commenting, console.logs, etc. I also refactored code to move common component structures/patterns across the app into individual components.

This code is meant to serve as example of logic/app development process which is why I committed these files specifically.
